      <p class="sandwich-description">
        The Reuben sandwich is an American grilled sandwich composed of corned beef, 
        Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing, grilled between slices of rye 
        bread. It is associated with kosher-style delicatessens, but it is not kosher, 
        because it contains both meat and cheese.
